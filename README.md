ShooterSubDownloader
====================
This is a shooter.cn subtitle download tool using C#.

// TODO


// Figure out what is idx format subtitle for DVD


A very simple Python CLI version for OS X and Linux is [here](https://github.com/magic282/ShooterSubPyDownloader).

ATTENTION: shooter.cn is not stable recently according to my test. So the tool may not work properly by saying download failed.

*注意：射手网提供的API最近不太稳定，下载器可能会提示下载失败。
